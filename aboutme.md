subtitle: A brief overview
---

I'm a data scientist with a passion for creating easy to understand explanations and visualizations as well as coordinating complex deployments across teams with diverse technical specializations. My background includes four years in pure mathematics (specializing in abstract and linear algebra) and six years in one-on-one and small-group education, which combined allow me to communicate precise information in an understandable fashion. Also a graduate of UT Dallas (B.S., Mathematics, 2015, *cum laude*). 

Some of my research interests include:
- Natural Language Processing
- Big data (AWS, GCP, etc.)
- Project management
- Effective altruism
- Quantitatively motivated public policy
- Sociology and group coordination

Currently located in DFW.
